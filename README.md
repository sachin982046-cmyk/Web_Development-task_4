# Responsive Website README

This project updates an existing desktop-only webpage to be mobile-friendly using CSS media queries.

# Features

Responsive layout using a @media (max-width: 768px) breakpoint.

Images scale automatically to fit smaller screens.

Navigation menu stacks vertically on mobile.

Columns convert to a single-column layout.

Overflow and horizontal scrolling issues fixed.

# How to Use

1. Add the included CSS file to your project.


2. Ensure your HTML contains the viewport meta tag:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


3. Test the layout using Chrome DevTools' device toolbar.



# Notes

Adjust breakpoints or styles as needed for your specific design.

Add additional styles for tablet or larger mobile screens if necessary.


Enjoy your mobile‑friendly site!
